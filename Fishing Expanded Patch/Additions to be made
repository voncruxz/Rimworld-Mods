- Crab trap
	- Crabs, Crayfish, Lobster
	- Work needed to empty them, different sizes that fit different amount of fish.
	- Work like Growing plots?
- Shellfish, maybe?
	- Clams, Mussels, Ouyster, Cockle, Scallop
		- Special fishing bill
	- Shrimp
		- Caught by netting (other types of catch as well)

	- Instead of current growing plot style.
	- Alternatively, patching for Colony Manager

	- Small fish stay the same
